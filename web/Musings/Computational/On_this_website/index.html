<h1 id="page-sizes">Page sizes</h1>
<p>The median desktop webpage, in this day and age, is a little over 1.5MB<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>; the median mobile page is 1.3MB.</p>
<h2 id="is-that-big">Is that big?</h2>
<p>By historical standards, this is excessive. In 2010, the average page size was just half a megabyte. These days, the median mobile page is the same size as the compressed<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> text of both the Bible and the Quran, and the desktop page is large enough to fit the Book of Mormon as well.</p>
<h2 id="is-that-too-big">Is that too big?</h2>
<p>The majority of these sites are serving mostly text; such text probably doesn't exceed 10KB in the majority cases. Rather, the page is bulked by adverts, excessively high-resolution images, and superfluous use of entire Javascript libraries.</p>
<h2 id="is-this-the-raving-of-a-lunatic">Is this the raving of a lunatic?</h2>
<p>Probably; but it is nevertheless of import. For a person like the author, on a humble mobile data package of 1GB each month, I am thus limited to about 26 webpages of median size per day; this is terribly inconvenient.</p>
<h2 id="this-webpage">This webpage</h2>
<p>I indulge myself by forcing you to download a Google font in order to read this page properly; however, this font is only 200KB, so even when you download this, this webpage is 7 times smaller than the median.</p>
<p>However, this font is cached for a year; so excluding this yearly download, this webpage is not significantly worse than raw text<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>, and is at least 100 times smaller than the average webpage. At this size, on my 1GB monthly plan, I would be able to read at least three long<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> pages per minute of my waking life.</p>
<h2 id="in-the-general-case">In the general case</h2>
<p>For a smaller, and thus faster, webpage, it usually helps to avoid large JS libraries, and superfluous or large images. Ideally, adverts ought not to be used, as - they are designed to distract from the page - they increase file size and load times significantly - they are blocked anyway - Patreon &amp;c. exist.</p>
<h1 id="static-webpages">Static webpages</h1>
<p>These give better performance, security, &amp;c.; this is well-documented. Website generators exist for this sort of thing; this webpage uses <a href="https://github.com/bwrs/bwrs.github.io">an original<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> website generator</a>.</p>
