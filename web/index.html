      <strong>Benedict Randall Shaw</strong> welcomes you to his homepage.
<hr>
I (somewhat) frequently write for <a href="https://librarian.cf">the Librarian</a>, as does <a href="https://Joshua%20Loo">Joshua Loo</a>. We have been known to collaborate with amusing results, and he has been known to simply exist with amusing results, so his website is worth observing.
<hr>
I am <a href="About#Olympiads">somewhat mathematically capable</a>.
<hr>
My email addresses include <code>benedictrandallshaw@gmail.com</code>, and, at least until 2020, <code>benedict.randallshaw@westminster.org.uk</code>.
<hr>
<p>I am <a href="About#Hobbies">mildly ridiculous</a>.</p>
