<h1 id="the-status-quo">The status quo</h1>
<p>A large number of mathematical concepts depend on other such concepts for their definition, proof, and understanding<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. This means that to learn about a given concept, one has to understand the concepts on which it depends, and consequently the concepts on which those depends, and so on.</p>
<p>In an academic course, this is perfectly acceptable, because such concepts are explained as one goes along, in an order that makes this feasible. However, to the mathematically minded or simply interested amateur, this is not really feasible.</p>
