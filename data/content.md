(he/him)

I am a first-year maths student at Trinity College, Cambridge, where I am also a member of the [choir](http://trinitycollegechoir.com).

My email addresses include `benedictrandallshaw@gmail.com` and `bwr26@cam.ac.uk`. I can also be contacted on many major social media platforms. I am usually happy for people to get in touch, but occasionally miss messages'; in such cases, I apologise profusely and recommend you send a follow-up.
