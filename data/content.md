I am a student reading maths at Trinity College, Cambridge, where I am also a baritone in the [college choir](http://trinitycollegechoir.com), and president of the [music society](https://www.tcms.org.uk). I am also president of the [university chamber choir](https://www.cmp.cam.ac.uk/cambridge-university-chamber-choir), and both junior treasurer and secretary of the [university opera society](http://www.cuos.co.uk).

My email addresses are `benedictrandallshaw@gmail.com` and `bwr26@cam.ac.uk`. I can also be contacted on various social media platforms. I am happy for people to get in touch, but sometimes miss messages, in which case please feel free to chase me up.
