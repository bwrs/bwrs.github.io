**Benedict Randall Shaw** welcomes you to his homepage.
<hr>
I (somewhat) frequently write for [the Librarian](https://librarian.cf), as does [Joshua Loo](https://joshualoo.net). We have been known to collaborate with amusing results, and he has been known to simply exist with amusing results, so his website is worth observing.
<hr>
I am [somewhat capable mathematically and linguistically](About#Olympiads).

My email addresses include `benedictrandallshaw@gmail.com`, and, at least until 2020, `benedict.randallshaw@westminster.org.uk`.
