I am a PhD student in combinatorics, supervised by Imre Leader, at Trinity College, Cambridge, where I am also a baritone in the [college choir](http://trinitycollegechoir.com), and president of the [university chamber choir](https://www.cmp.cam.ac.uk/cambridge-university-chamber-choir). My email address is `bwr26 (at) cam (dot) ac (dot) uk`.
