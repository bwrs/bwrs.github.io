#Olympiads[^1]
As a combined result of some personal skill and some not inconsiderable serendipity:

 - I have been selected for the UK team of six competing in the *International Mathematics Olympiad, 2018.
 - I received an honourable mention in the *Romanian Masters of Mathematics*^[an Olympiad of difficulty comparable to the IMO], 2018.
 - I was a reserve for the UK team of four for the *International Olympiad in Informatics*^[an Olympiad which mostly focuses on algorithm design], 2017.

#Hobbies

 - I claim that bellringing and lawn bowls are sports, and am therefore quite "sporty"^[I have [rung a quarter peal[^2]](https://bb.ringingworld.co.uk/view.php?id=1237061)].
 - I write articles mathematic and otherwise for [the Librarian](https://librarian.cf), a school publication run by [Joshua Loo](https://joshualoo.net).
 - I dabble in bookbinding, and, to a lesser extent, debating.

[^1]: From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Science_Olympiad):

> The International Science Olympiads are a group of worldwide annual competitions in various areas of science. The competitions are designed for the 4-6 best high school students from each participating country selected through internal National Science Olympiads, with the exception of the IOL, which allows two teams per country, the IOI, which allows two teams from the hosting country... Although the competitions are aimed for secondary school pupils, the standards of the exams are extremely high. In fact, in several countries, achieving a high ranking in any ISO guarantees access to a university of choice and a fellowship.
