      <strong>Benedict Randall Shaw</strong> would welcome you to his homepage, were this his homepage, which it isn't. In fact, this is the homepage of the unlisted section<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, which with any luck is not to be found on mainstream search engines; so those who are here have either stalked me very effectively, or have been linked to this subpage by someone, probably me. It therefore contains more compromising and amusing materials.

I (somewhat) frequently write for <a href="https://librarian.cf">the Librarian</a>, as does <a href="https://joshualoo.net">Joshua Loo</a>. We have been known to collaborate with amusing results, and he has been known to simply exist with amusing results, so his website is worth observing.

I am <a href="About#Olympiads">somewhat capable mathematically and linguistically</a>.
