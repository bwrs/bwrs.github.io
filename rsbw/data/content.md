**Benedict Randall Shaw** would welcome you to his homepage, were this his homepage, which it isn't. In fact, this is the homepage of the unlisted section^[Like the dark web, only a) perfectly legal and b) not named by a twelve-year-old who wants to sound like a spy.], which with any luck is not to be found on mainstream search engines; so those who are here have either stalked me very effectively, or have been linked to this subpage by someone, probably me. It therefore contains more compromising and amusing materials.

I (somewhat) frequently write for [the Librarian](https://librarian.cf), as does [Joshua Loo](https://joshualoo.net). We have been known to collaborate with amusing results, and he has been known to simply exist with amusing results, so his website is worth observing.

I am [somewhat capable mathematically and linguistically](About#Olympiads).

My email addresses include `benedictrandallshaw@gmail.com`, and, at least until 2020, `benedict.randallshaw@westminster.org.uk`.
